review: |-
  The menu is 'Asian' rather than any specific cuisine, which is usually a red flag. However, everything on the menu at Hsin is amazing. So great for a diverse dining experience where you need to find something for everyone.
recommend: |-
  Salt and pepper pumkin and eggplant is delicious as is the dry chili chicken.
